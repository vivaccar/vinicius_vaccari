            <h1 class="proj-title">PUSH_SWAP</h1>
            <p class="proj-p">PushSwap is a sorting algorithm project that involves organizing a random stack of numbers in ascending order using two stacks, named 'a' and 'b.' The goal is to achieve the desired order through a set of predefined operations. The operations include swapping elements, pushing elements between stacks, and rotating elements within a stack.</p>

            <h4>Rules</h4>
            <p class="proj-p">You have two stacks named a and b. At the beginning: Stack a contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers, which cannot be duplicated. Stack b is initially empty. The objective is to sort the numbers in ascending order into stack a.</p>
            <h4>Available Operations</h4>
            <p>sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.</p>
            <p>sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.</p>
            <p>ss: Perform sa and sb at the same time.</p>
            <p>pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do nothing if b is empty.</p>
            <p>pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if a is empty.</p>
            <p>ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one.</p>
            <p>rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.</p>
            <p>rr: Perform ra and rb at the same time.</p>
            <p>rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.</p>
            <p>rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.</p>
            <p>rrr: Perform rra and rrb at the same time.</p>
            <h4>Turkish Algorithm</h4>
            <p class="proj-p">Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:</p>
            <p>Initial Setup: Push two numbers from STACK_A to STACK_B</p>
            <p>For each number in STACK_A, calculate the number of operations needed to push it into the correct position in STACK_B(above the smallest number, closest). Operations may include rotations of the stacks and pushing elements. Keep track of the cheapest number. Push the Cheapest Number.</p>
            <p>Push the cheapest number until stack A has only 3 numbers.</p>
            <p>These three elements can be sorted with one or two operations</p>
            <p>Push all elements from STACK_B back to STACK_A. Before pushing each element, check if it's in the correct position; if not, rotate STACK_A until the correct position is reached.</p>
            <p>Ensure that the minimum number is at the top of STACK_A to ensure the entire stack is sorted.</p>
